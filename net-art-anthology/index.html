        StarryNight was developed as an artistic interface for the curated, online archive of Rhizome’s email discussion list, an important forum for artists working with new forms of media in the late 1990s. Each week, selected messages from the list—including critical exchanges, sharing resources and information, and artwork in email form—were saved to the archive, which was called Textbase.
        <br><br>
        In StarryNight, each email in the archive was represented by a glowing point of light against a dark background, which would increase in brightness each time its corresponding message was accessed in the archive. Users could navigate among them by selecting assigned keywords, which would draw “constellations” connecting related emails in the database.
        <br><br>
        Online again following a major effort by Rhizome’s preservation team, StarryNight is both a classic work of information aesthetics and a rich portrait of Rhizome’s early online community.

        <p class="fact">Rhizome was founded by artist Mark Tribe in 1996 as an email discussion list for artists working in emergent forms of media art.</p>

      <div class="fact-box fact-three">
        <p class="fact">“I felt it was important that we begin to develop an aesthetic and theoretical vocabulary to discuss and understand these emergent forms of media art. I initially thought of it as a place for discussion, exchange of ideas, and information, but also for presentation, so people could see one another’s work. — Mark Tribe</p>

      <div class="fact-box fact-four">
        <p class="fact">Each week, selected emails would be saved to an edited archive called TextBase, with keywords added to each message for more effective searching.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fact-box fact-five">
        <p class="fact">When a visitor would access an email on Rhizome’s web-based archive, a dot would appear on the black background of StarryNight. With each subsequent visit, it would grow slightly brighter.</p>

      <div class="fact-box fact-six">
        <p class="fact">Users could click a given star, triggering a pop-up menu. They could opt to read the message, which would cause it to appear onscreen, or select a keyword associated with the text.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fact-box fact-seven">
        <p class="fact">Because of a data loss that took place more than ten years ago, the new restoration contains only a subset of the original Textbase, which was recovered from materials associated Martin Wattenberg’s Spiral. The work originally would have had more visible stars.</p>

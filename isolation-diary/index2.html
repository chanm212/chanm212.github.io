        They say that shoppers are swarming stores. I’ve already witnessed a ton of people bulk-buying toilet paper, which makes wonder if they think they’re gonna shit themselves in quarantine. It’s making it hard for other people to buy toilet paper when they actually need it. I’m not sure if bulk buying is even necessary right now as all of the grocery stores are still open and will presumably stay open.

        Things are getting real. It doesn’t feel real because I’ve only been home a few days and I’m pretty used to entertaining myself when I’m alone and bored. But things are getting cancelled and the government is restricting groups of 50 people or more from gathering.

        Dallas shuts it down. The gloves and the toxic symbol on the front page image really make me feel more and more like this is an apocalyptic situation we are living in right now.

        I know the economy is suffering really badly, and I’m extremely grateful I am not largely affected by it yet. I wonder what the government is going to do. I wonder if Trump will actually try to help people.

        I’ve heard horror stories of people being forced to work at their non-essential jobs when most companies are doing work from home already.

        Texas has shut most things down but that mainly applies to schools and gathering places. Places like Michaels and Joann’s are not yet closed, and a lot fo restaurants are starting to do take-out. It feels overwhelming already to be home alone with my mom, who is especially paranoid.

        The self-isolation is in full effect and it feels almost normal to be talking about quarantining.

        The testing is one of the biggest issues right now, as it seems like there aren’t enough tests around the country. Meanwhile, celebrities or rich people who have a slight inkling they might have it are getting hold of tests. Things are starting to get divisive because the testing is unfairly distributed and Trump seems to be giving people false about how many tests there are.

        Shelter in place ordered. Now it’s really getting apocalyptic. Shelter in place sounds like a bomb is about to go off, but in reality, people are just worried about getting sick. A few weeks ago, coronavirus was equated to the flu. Now it’s a death sentence for anyone at risk. I don’t know how to feel because there’s still conflicting opinions about it.

        I hope this is a bi[artisan issue and politics doesn’t affect how quickly the government can help. Trump is in charge and I hope he does something right for once. I still don’t trust him to handle this.

        The news is saying “frontlines” a lot. Except the people on the frontlines are not soldiers anymore. They are doctors, nurses and grocery store workers. It’s insane because they didn’t sign up for this. Especially grocery store workers. Do they even get a choice?

        I don’t know how to fix the economy, I guess the government doesn’t either. The company I intern for is dissolving because they make party supplies and no one is having parties. They can’t stay afloat. It’s really heartbreaking because I loved them and they were such a great startup and the founder worked so hard. I was their first intern ever.

        The number of infected people is rising. My sister is in Wisconsin with her boyfriend and said she is sick. She can’t get tested b because she’s not over 65 and isn’t an essential worker. We might not ever know. She will get better though.

        The relief bill is being passed, which is good news, I hope. 2 trillion dollars seems like an unfathomable amount of money, but I don’t know if it will actually be able to help people. Will it be enough? It’s a start I guess.

        It’s getting scarier and scarier how easily this thing spreads. It feels like if I go to the grocery store I won’t get infected, but hearing how fast it spreads makes me worried. The deaths are what really scare me. I know no one close to me is going to die right now but I don’t know what the future holds.

        I’m worried about my grandparents. They are isolating, and even my Nani in India is isolating, but still. I’m worried about my dad because he’s diabetic. But he doesn’t seem to care honestly. He’s still going to work, just staying away from people and isolating in his personal office.

    <div class="text-container"><p class="paragraph">StarryNight was developed as an artistic interface for the curated, online archive of Rhizome’s email discussion list, an important forum for artists working with new forms of media in the late 1990s. Each week, selected messages from the list—including critical exchanges, sharing resources and information, and artwork in email form—were saved to the archive, which was called Textbase.
    <br>
    In StarryNight, each email in the archive was represented by a glowing point of light against a dark background, which would increase in brightness each time its corresponding message was accessed in the archive. Users could navigate among them by selecting assigned keywords, which would draw “constellations” connecting related emails in the database.
    <br>
    Online again following a major effort by Rhizome’s preservation team, StarryNight is both a classic work of information aesthetics and a rich portrait of Rhizome’s early online community.</p></div>
    <div class="info-container"><p class="info">Rhizome was founded by artist Mark Tribe in 1996 as an email discussion list for artists working in emergent forms of media art.</p></div>
    <div class="info-container second-info"><p class="info">StarryNight is both a map and a community record. As a navigation tool, it was impossible to use without leaving a trace of which texts the user would pursue and which they would ignore.</p></div>
    <div class="info-container third-info"><p class="info">Inspired by conversations with Nettime cofounder Pit Schultz, Tribe envisioned that emails from the list would be archived in a web-accessible database—then a novel concept.</p></div>
    <div class="info-container fourth-info"><p class="info">Because of a data loss that took place more than ten years ago, the new restoration contains only a subset of the original Textbase, which was recovered from materials associated Martin Wattenberg’s Spiral. The work originally would have had more visible stars.</p></div>

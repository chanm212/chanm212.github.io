      Year two of Pastrytown is upon us with your favorite dessert flavors ready to climb in the ring for an all out battle of flavor! Coffee suplexing chocolate, vanilla pile-driving cherry, cereal crunching cinnamon to a fine powder. The result is a Pastrytown extravaganza sweeter and rowdier than last year.

      Join us Saturday, March 7th along with 50+ of our closest brewer buds bringing their best pastry stouts, barrel-aged barley wines, sought after mead and fruited Berliners. We will also feature paired desserts, timed-releases and of course, wrestling.

      Come thirsty and ready to have some fun.
